        <h2>DESK</h2>
<h3>I wanted a space where I could study, surf the internet, house my electronics and play games, but, I couldn’t find anything I really liked in any stores. So, I opted to build my own.</h3>
<h3>After I completed the design on paper, I started cutting some birch plywood and maple. It’s a fairly simple design but has removable, adjustable shelves, an open back for ventilation, and additional support.</h3>
<h3>Birch plywood and solid maple were the two basic materials I used for the project.</h3>
<h3>I used a table saw, miter saw, nail gun, and planer to work on this project. Finally, I stained and sealed the desk so that it would stand up to some abuse. It took quite a while to put this together but I have always been very happy with the results.</h3>

<h2>WOODEN CLOCK<h2>
<h3>I have had an interest in watches for quite some time. I bought my first in 2006 and still wear it frequently. I also think that mechanical clocks are really neat. This is where this project started for me. </h3>
<h3>To see if this was something I would enjoy, I began researching wooden clocks. Mechanical clocks are interesting works of art that take patience, and precision to build.</h3>
<h3>Eventually, i'd like to design my own. The CNC skills I have gained will hopefully link everything together nicely.</h3> 
<h3>For now, I purchased a cheap scroll saw from craigslist and started cutting out gears by hand. It’s a very tedious process, but also very relaxing. Hopefully when i’m done, this clock will tick away loudly.</h3>
