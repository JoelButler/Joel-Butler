        <h2>PERSONAL WEBSITE</h2>
<h3>This is my first attempt at HTML and CSS. Prior to this website, I had zero experience! 
HTML, CSS and JavaScript are all a large work in progress for me; however I have been thoroughly enjoying 
learning another new skill. Especially one I believe will be valuable to me in the future.</h3>
        <h3>Some skills I learned while building this website:</h3>
        <h3><ul>
          <li>Plan and build CSS webpage layouts</li>
          <li>Style pages and text using CSS and HTML</li>
          <li>Understand box models padding and positioning</li>
          <li>Create and style forms for gathering user information</li>
          <li>Position images and website links</li>
          </ul>
       
<h3>Luckily, I had some basic knowledge of C, C++ and Arduino programming prior to starting this project. 
These skills helped me understand the code I was reading in books, and in online tutorials.</h3>
        
<h3>I started from the ground up with a simple background image and some overlaid text. 
From there, I added a responsive fixed top navigation bar and website footer. </h3>
<h3>I used free graphic design software called InkScape to create various vector images.</h3> 
<h3>I also learned how to use images to link to various pages such as Instagram, and email.</h3>
<h3>I find building “content” to be the most time consuming aspect. After planning, it takes some time to complete various pages. </h3>
<h3>Solving design and implementation problems has been exiting. Problems absorb me and I really enjoy when the lightbulb clicks and something I have been struggling with suddenly works as expected. Sure enough, solving enough small problems creates something complex and attractive. </h3>
<h3>Something I learned quickly is that planning is likely the most important part of building a website. This is something i should always recognize when starting a new project. With a solid plan, building a vision is simple easier.</h3>
<h3>Out of all of the personal projects I have undertaken, I would argue that this has website been the most rewarding so far. </h3>
